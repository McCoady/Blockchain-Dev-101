Basic user interface for users to claim 200BILD & attach a username to their Ropsten testnet account. 

Folders include both the coin release contract & the BILD Token (following the openzeppelin ERC20 standard). 

Hardhat was used to create the project. 

Further tests need to be done to check there are no unexpected bugs with the contract. 

The app can have future pages (such as a leaderboard, roadmap, project showcase) in future as the community grows.
