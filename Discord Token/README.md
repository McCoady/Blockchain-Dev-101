# Blockchain-Dev-101

Github for the Blockchain Dev 101 Discord group. 

We are hoping to grow some interesting projects to build an on-chain ecosystem for the Discord server and give people new to blockchain development the opportunity to build their experience working on real projects. 

## Planned Projects
A list of project ideas currently being worked on by the community:

### An ERC20 Token
This token will act as a tracker for a members involvement in the community.
This includes:
    - Being given as a prize for future Community Project Competitions/Hackathons.
    - Having the ability for server members to 'tip' other members.
    - Participating in airdrops. 

### A Leaderboard
The leaderboard will be responsible for keeping track of who has earned the most tokens. 

### On-chain Group Portfolio
A portfolio that shows off projects produced by members of the discord.
This includes:
    - A front-end to improve useability.
    - The ability to vote for and/or tip projects.
