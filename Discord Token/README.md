# Blockchain-Dev-101 Token

Repo for the Blockchain Dev 101 Discord groups ERC20 Token. 

## Description

This token will act as a tracker for a members involvement in the community.
This includes:

    - Being given as a prize for future Community Project Competitions/Hackathons.
    - Participating in airdrops. 

## Spec

The token is mintable. This is currently by token deployer but this should eventually be passed into the control of a smart contract.
The token has 0 decimals. As this token doesn't plan to operate as a currency fractionalisation of the token shouldn't be necessary.

## To do

The token name and symbol are currently still placeholders. 
Further Truffle Tests required to confirm everything works as expected:
   Test joinDrop function (balance goes to users, leaves contract account).
